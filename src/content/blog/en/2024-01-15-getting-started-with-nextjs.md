# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for modern web development. It provides many useful features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and more.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers many benefits over plain React:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static pages at build time
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updates static pages without rebuilding the entire site
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within the same project
